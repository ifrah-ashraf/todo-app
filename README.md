This project was bootstrapped using `create vite@latest`


### This is a basic todo web-app where you can  
-Add a todo
-Edit the existing todo*
-delete the todo

If you want to run locally just **copy the code** and change the directory in the terminal to **todo-app** after that just run `npm run dev` and click on the URL (using `ctrl+click`).
 

## Some React + vite information you can ignore this

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
